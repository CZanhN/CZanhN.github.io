### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 has a special place in my heart for being the very first, true coding experience that I ever had. As simple as it may be as a program that is solely about inputting nouns within a pre-structured sentence, it was probably the first time I realized how amazing coding was. It is perhaps the closest thing I have to defying a principle of physics: creating something out of nothing.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, is among my favorites for being the first lab I have ever had the pleasure of truly struggling. In fact, it was the lab that got me to really pull out almost every reading and lecture I had in order to navigate through it all, since creating a blackjack program was basically creating a game. Having to really understand how to use if-else statements would become a major foundation for any upcoming labs, and future coding endeavors.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was among my favorites to have coded because I had to learn how to seamlessly integrate the power of parsing CSV data in order to program the handling of state-based data. I particularly enjoyed implementing the ReadCSV function, as it required me to understand edge cases which I feel will be important for the future. Ultimately, however, the lab reinforced my understanding of “encapsulation” and how well-structured classes make complex tasks easier to manage and extend.
